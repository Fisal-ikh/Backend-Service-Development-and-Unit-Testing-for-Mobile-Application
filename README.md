Competency Project: Unit Testing for Error Detection

Introduction

This is a mobile application development project for Grand Strand Systems. The task involves creating and testing the contact, task, and appointment services for a mobile application to add, update, and delete contact, task, and appointment objects within the application. You will be provided with the requirements for each service, and your job is to code up the application and provide unit tests to verify that it meets the customerâ€™s requirements.

Requirements

The project consists of three milestones, where you will develop the code and unit tests for the following services:

ContactService: This service manages storing and modifying contact objects with specific requirements.
TaskService: This service manages storing and modifying task objects with specific requirements.
AppointmentService: This service manages storing and modifying appointment objects with specific requirements.
Deliverables

The deliverables for this project are:

ContactService, TaskService, and AppointmentService Files
Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java
Task.java, TaskService.java, TaskTest.java, TaskServiceTest.java
Appointment.java, AppointmentService.java, AppointmentTest.java, AppointmentServiceTest.java
Rubric

To complete this project, you will need to verify that each class and service meets the requirements through JUnit tests. The goal is to achieve 80% or higher test coverage for the java files.

How to Run

To run the project, clone the repository and use a Java IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ to open and run the files. Make sure to run the tests to verify that the classes and services meet the requirements.
